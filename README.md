# Harp, Gulp, BrowserSync

A ready-to-go Harp boilerplate with the following:

- Gulp (for automated building)
- BrowserSync (for auto css injection and html reload)
- FontAwesome (for starting with a massive icon set)

To set things up, do:

```console
harp init src --boilerplate supsupmo/harp-gulp-browsersync
npm install
bower install
```

Then run the following:

```console
gulp
```

Now create and code till your heart is content.
